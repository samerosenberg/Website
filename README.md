# Website 

## What it is
I am creating a website to display my interests, hobbies and personal portfolio. It is currently a *work in progress* and is not hosted on any site but feel free to download the files and check it out if interested.

## How I'm making it
I am using a bootstrap framework to create my website. Using the **Brackets** software I can write code and watch it update in real time right on the website. 

## What I am learning
I am enjoying the process of learning HTML, CSS and some Javascript to create this website from the ground up. It has been a lot of fun customizing everything so far and I'm looking forward to the finished product.
