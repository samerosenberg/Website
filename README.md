# My Website

This was my first attempt at a website that I built while in college for a professional development class. I had a lot of fun building it and learned a lot about HTML/CSS/JS along the way. It was built off of a bootstrap5 template and been fairly untouched since it's initial creation. It used to be hosted by my college for viewing but I have since graduated, so now it can be found on [serose99.github.io/Website](https://serose99.github.io/Website) thanks to Github Pages. Feel free to check it out and let me know your thoughts.

If you would like to see my most recent website porfolio however head on over to [samrosenberg.io](http://samrosenberg.io) or the repository [Website2.0](https://github.com/serose99/Website2.0)
